###Approach for component test
We mainly make component test for HomeCard, ListingCreate, ListingPublish, NavBar,Register and SearchForm

1.For the components used to display content, we focus on checking the tag and classname, as well as its text

2.For components that have a button, we mainly test the response of the button by simulating a click

3.For components that have input boxes, we simulate the input to check that the values entered are correct
