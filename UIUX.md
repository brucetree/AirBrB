The following tricks are used in UI design to improve the  accessibility

1. All css files are placed in the CSS folder, and some css files (such as button.css) can be referenced by multiple jsx files.

2. In the process of designing the interface, the width of most components is set to 400px, 600px, 800px or 1200px. Doing so can make the interface more tidy and concise. When the screen width is less than 700px, the width of these components is set to 400px to adapt to the display effect of a narrow screen.

3. Some areas, such as displaying a certain listing card, use rounded corners to enhance the visual experience.

4. The color style is unified, and the colors used in all interfaces are only gray, orange and green, which ensures the consistency of the website style.
